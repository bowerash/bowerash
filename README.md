- 👋 Hi, I'm @bowerash, but you can call me Ashley!

- 👀 I'm interested in developing my skills in data science and analytics. My particular interests are in forecasting and data visualization. My goal is to increase the availability 
and speed of data across a given team or an organization. Additionally, I hope to improve my coworkers' jobs by automating routine data-driven tasks to save hours of manual work.

- 🌱 I'm currently learning R Studio and information management. I am working on my master's in Data Science and Analytics from GVSU. I am presently a Marketing Database Analyst
for Gun Lake Casino, but starting in a few weeks, I will be the new reporting analyst for Kellogg's ITC Fiance team! 

- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on R-based projects right now, but as I develop my skills, the possibilities are endless! As I grow my skills I would like to get 
more into machine learning, process automation, and forecasting.
